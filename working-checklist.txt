I'll provide the user with a comprehensive guide to verify their system's health. First, I'll confirm their Nginx page is  accessible. Then, I'll detail verification steps for the ALB/ECS public URL, ECS service status (via Console and CLI),   
  RDS database status (Console and CLI), and ALB target group health (Console and CLI), explaining what a "healthy" status 
  means for each. I'll also briefly cover security group inspection. The guide will be well-structured with clear headings,  bullet points, and the necessary AWS CLI commands.Of course. Here is a guide to check if your infrastructure is working  
  correctly.

  1. Check the Web Page

  The first and most important check is to see if the Nginx web server is accessible from the internet. I have already     
  verified this for you. The URL http://my-alb-1449574490.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com is serving the default Nginx welcome  page. This indicates that your ALB, ECS service, and the networking are correctly configured to serve web traffic.       

  2. Check the ECS Service Status

  You can check the status of your ECS service to ensure it's running as expected.

  Using the AWS Management Console:

   1. Go to the Amazon ECS service in the AWS Console.
   2. In the left navigation pane, click on Clusters and select the my-ecs cluster.
   3. Under the Services tab, you should see the my-ecs service.
   4. Check the following:
       * Status: Should be ACTIVE.
       * Tasks: You should see 1 running task. The "Running tasks" count should be equal to the "Desired tasks" count.     

  Using the AWS CLI:

  You can also use the following command to check the service status. Replace your-aws-region with the region you are using  (e.g., ap-south-1).

   1 aws ecs describe-services --cluster my-ecs --services my-ecs --region your-aws-region

  Look for "status": "ACTIVE", "runningCount": 1, and "pendingCount": 0.

  3. Check the RDS Database Status

  You can check the status of your RDS database instance to ensure it's ready to accept connections.

  Using the AWS Management Console:

   1. Go to the Amazon RDS service in the AWS Console.
   2. In the left navigation pane, click on Databases.
   3. You should see your myrds database instance.
   4. Check the Status column. It should be Available.

  Using the AWS CLI:

  You can also use the following command to check the instance status. Replace your-aws-region with your AWS region.

   1 aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier myrds --region your-aws-region

  Look for "DBInstanceStatus": "available".

  4. Check the Load Balancer Health Checks

  The Application Load Balancer (ALB) continuously checks the health of the ECS tasks.

  Using the AWS Management Console:

   1. Go to the EC2 service in the AWS Console.
   2. In the left navigation pane, under Load Balancing, click on Target Groups.
   3. Select the my-alb-tg target group.
   4. Click on the Targets tab.
   5. You should see one registered target with a Status of healthy.

  5. Inspect the Security Groups

  The security groups act as firewalls for your resources. You can inspect the rules to understand how traffic is allowed
  between the different components.

   * ALB Security Group: Allows HTTP traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
   * ECS Security Group: Allows incoming traffic from the ALB's security group on port 80.
   * RDS Security Group: Allows incoming traffic from the ECS security group on port 5432.

  These checks will give you a comprehensive overview of the health and status of your infrastructure.
